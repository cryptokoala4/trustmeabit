# Trust me a Bit
_tl;dr: Support Reporters and Writers anonymously with Bitcoins_
#### Introduction
Trust me a Bit (TMAB) lets you use Bitcoins to fund Reporters and Writers anonymously. The aim is to encourage writers to engage in quality journalism, by being rewarded with Bitcoin fundings from its (_cough_ generous _cough_) readers through TMAB or plain Bitcoin donations.

#### Features
- Deposit Bitcoins securely into your unique Bitcoin wallet on TMAB.
- Withdraw your bitcoins to other wallets to cashout
- Obtain a unique TMAB public link for users to fund you.
- Create a public profile of yourself for users to know more about you
- See your Bitcoin balance


#### Why do this?
For a while, anyone in the world can call themselves a writer and some actually produces good writings. They have been undervalued through social media, so TMAB partly exists to help fund or show appreciation to writers who are genuinely producing good work.
